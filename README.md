This repository contains the Matlab scripts and functions for the numerical solution of the 
epidemic model developed to evaluate quantitively the effectiveness of digital contact tracing apps.
The model is described in the (UNDER REVISION) paper:
 Enrique Hernández-Orallo, Pietro Manzoni, ACarlos T. Calafate, Juan-Carlos Cano 
"A Methodology for Evaluating Digital Contact Tracing Apps: Lessons Learned from COVID-19 to Improve their Efficiency"

Specifically, the file "SIR_Trace_withVacc_Euler.m" contain the function that solves numerically the Epìdemic Model. As an example of how to use this function, file "Test_SIR_Det.m" contains the code to generate most of the plots of the aforementioned paper. Finally, file "Plot_Threshold" contains the code with the threshold expression and some example of plots used in the paper.
